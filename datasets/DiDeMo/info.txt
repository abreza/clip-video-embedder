 For easier annotation, each video is split into 5-second temporal chunks.
The first temporal chunk correpsonds to seconds 0-5 in the video, the second
temporal chunk correpsonds to seconds 5-10, etc.

The following describes the different fields in the json files:

	• annotation_id: Annotation ID for description
	• description: Description for a specific video segment
	• video: Video name
	• times: Ground truth time points marked by annotators. The time points indicate which chunk includes the start of the moment and which chunk includes the end of the moment. An annotation of (3,3) indicates that a moment starts at 3x5=15 seconds and ends at (3+1)x5=20 seconds. An annotation of (1,4) indicates that a moment starts at 1x5=5 seconds and ends at (4+1)x5=20 seconds. Note that the last segment is not always 5 seconds long. For example, for a video which is 28.2 seconds long, the annotation (5,5) will correpsond to 5x5=25 seconds to min((5+1)x5 seconds, video length) = 28.2 seconds. Some videos are longer than 30 seconds. These videos were truncated to 30 seconds during annotation.
	• download_link: A download link for the video. Unfortunately, this download link does not work for many Flickr videos anymore. See "Getting the Videos" for more details.
	• num_segments: Some videos are a little shorter than 25 seconds, so were split into five temporal chunks instead of six.
